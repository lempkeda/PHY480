RESUBMISSION.



3. The slope of the extrap_diff graph equal to about 4 (to the right of the optimal h value) because it is a Richardson
	extrapolation and thus has an error that scales with h^4 . 

	The notes mention you can apply this Richardsom extrapolation more than once so you could presumably combine even
	more h sizes that are different in order to further refine the result. You could get an extremely accurate
	estimation with this but it seems like this method would be very computationally intensive if you do it more than once.

4. This error on the left size is due to too small mesh size and is caused by machine imprecision in representing numbers that
	small. These slopes are all the same because once you have a mesh size that small,the function becomes closer and
	closer to locally linear so what method you use to approximate will not matter in the face of the errors caused
	by machine imprecision.

4. Plot saved.

	The slopes are the same because the errors of these methods still follow the same power law. There is a different
	function now that has a different base error scaling these power laws so the intercept is different.

Linear Algebra with GSL routines.

	There is probably Matrix multiplication happening buried in these routines so it probaby scales around N^3. 
	I know matrix multiplication scales n^3 but GSL is probably extremely well optimized so it could be a little less or
	a little more than this as I do not really know how it works exactly.

Plotting run times:

	Whenever I try to run this code I get cryptic errors. I even got help from a classmate and even copying his code it does
	not run. However, I looked at his plot and it completely agrees with my prediction. (runtimeplot.png).

	The slope is very close to 3 which is the exact ballpark I guessed.
