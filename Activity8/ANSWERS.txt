ACTIVITY 8

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
LOST MY ANSWSERS 
I let my laptop die without saving and lost all of what I wrote down for this activity up until the last section (chaos)
Theres not a ton of questions on this activity but I try my best here to recreate without redoing everything.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Strings and Things:

	I was able to manipulate the file names as directed using string streams. I set the diffeq_pendulum program
	to outpute a .dat file based on the alpha value, and used this to answer questions.
	
	I changed it back to the default name for the final section however, just so the live plotting worked which
	is really nice to see the complicated oscillations. 

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Damped (Undriven) Pendulum:

	Succeeding in manipulating file names

	I used the same default value for theta0 for all three.
	ALPHA VALUES:
		Underdamped: 0.2
		Critical damping : 2.0
		Overdamping : 4.0

	I chose these values for clarity is seeing the difference. Critical and overdamping have a similar path but it
	is apparent that the critical damping reaches equilibrium much faster as is characteristic of it.

	I chose a low underdamped value because it makes a very pretty spiral

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Damped Driven Pendulum:

	1. The green points are useful for seeing each start of a new oscillation in the driving force. If these
	appear in around the same place in each cycle of the pendulum then you know that their freqency are the same 
	(or at least some integer multiple of eachother)
	Furthermore you can see from the position of these greenpoints from the position axes how out of phase	
	the driving force is from the pendulum.

	2. It took around until t=55 for the transients to go completely away and plotting from here we get pure
	steady oscillations.

Chaos

	1. One way to see how many "periods" are in the limit cycles is to count how many times the phase space
	plot loops around its (0,0) point (or like (-2pi, 0) if the pendulum flips over).

	Im not sure what is meant by f(t) being built by multiple frequencies but the behavior seen where there are multiple
	"periods" before this larger pattern repeats again is very cool.

	Like in the thrid example where there are three full swings of the pendulum, each one growing in amplitude,
	before the pendulum flips over and does the same thing again -2pi radians away. 

	
	2. An extremely small change in starting conditions causes a huge change in the entire behavior.
	It starts out similar but quickly turns into a completely different system entirely.
