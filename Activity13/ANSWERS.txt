Overview: Simulation of 2D Ising Model [HTML5 version]:

	2: At high temperture, the system is extremely random and fast changing. Any regions of yellow or blue are small
	and short lived. The overall magnetization is around 0 and stays there consistently. 

	3: The system does not always end up in a completely ferromagnetic state. Most of the time with rapid cooling
	 it ends completely magnetized to +1 or -1.
	However, some of the time there are bands of +1 and -1 existing next to eachother in equilibrium. Like where a local
	minimum on energy is reached and the randomness (temperture) isn't enough to get out of this valley and reach the
	true minimum energy. 
	In this case the magnetization is somewhere between -1 and 1 and it is stable there as long as the temperture remains
	low. 

	4: The system obviously becomes more random as the temperature increases. However if you slowly heat from a ferromagnetic
	state, it takes around 2.27 for the opposite spin to take over and for the average to really start trending toward 0.
	I think it would look sort of like a cubic root function. 
	THIs 2.27 value is likely the temp at which permanent magnetism is lost. It might not go back to the state it was in.
	
	My beautiful sketch can be found as BeautifulSketch.png

	5: With a larger size, the same patterns at each temperature can be found just repeated and vice versa with smaller sizes
	With large sizes, it seems like it takes longer to reach a final state when cooled. 
	I'm not sure however how size relates to the probability of being stuck at a local minimum.

Monte Carlo Sampling

	1: J=1 is ferromagnet and J=-1 is antiferromagnet fittingly.
	Ground state of a ferromagnet has 0 magnetic field?

	2: According to eqn 13.6:
		To get hamiltonian, you take whats given :muliply -J * the sum of Si*Sj over i and j and you subtract
		the sum of H*Si iterated over i. H is the magnetic field. 

	3: There are 1048576 total configurations. It would take twice as long?
	
	4: the number of energies is 2n + 1. So there are 10 energy values possible here. 

	5: This is the code for the boundary conditions
		// now for the last site using periodic boundary conditions
    		nearest = num_sites - 1;
   		 energy += - J_ising * double(configuration[nearest] * configuration[0]);
	Instead of this, you could also use periodic boundary conditions. 

	6: 
	// find the partition function at temperature kT
  	double Z_exact = 0.;
  	for (int i = 0; i < num_energies; i++)
  	{   // this assumes the allowed energies are integers
   		 Z_exact += double(energy_count[i]) * exp(-energy_i(i)/kT);
  	}
	
	It is equal to 2.1.5 in the notes in the way described. The exp(-E/kT) is added for each spin config. 

	7: It used the bool return value of the next_configuration function and the termination condition for the do while
	loop. This way the constucts the complete set. 


	2: got correct looking answers from running the program.

	3: plot saved as EnergyDistribComp.png

	- The random sampling is centered around 0 because when all of the spin states are random, on average they will
	cancel out and end with 0 baseline energy. This would correspond with a very high temperature?

	- Random sampling may pose a major problem when dealing with thermal averages because it has equal probability of 
	sampling at the extremes as a mean value. 

	4: it looks like 2.1.39b is used.

The Two_D Ising Model

	1: The 2D case is the same as the 1D except repeated for as many times as the 1D is long.
	It doesnt use a 2D vector for the 2D case which is kinda smart as it allows the 1D code to be somewhat reused.

	2: plot saved as 2DIsingModel.png
	This different end energy that sometimes happens is probably the same thing that happens in the simulation at the
	start of this assignment. There is a stable state reached where sections of the simulation are in opposite directions
	
	It takes to about t=50 for kT = 0.5 to reach equilibrium and only slightly longer <100 for kT = 1.0 .
	For kT = 2.0 it takes until about t=100 for it to reach the range where is changes chaotically.

	You would not want to use the configuration at the beginning as the spin states are random. You would want the stable
	state reached so you could just ignore all values below a certain time (ie. t=500)

	3: I changed J_ising from 1 to -1

	4: Cooling: It seems to be aproximately the same results as doing it from a random state. 
	Not sure what effect the slow cooling has on the probability of the overall state ending at a local instead of an absolute
	minima. 

	5: Save the old energy in memory so you only have to calculate new?
	

	6: Phase transition

	As it cools, the magnetization starts to stray away from 0 until it gets in the point where is suddently switches to
	being completely one direction magnetized. I also observed a really cool thing in the plot I saved where it becomes 
	magnetic in the positive direction, flips to be negatively magnetic with the temperature drop, then flips to be positive
	again at the next temp drop. 

	This probably only happens due to the small size however. 

	- The effect above is the reason one would use the absolute value of magnetization. With these small simulations, there
	is a large enough chance of a large section of the board to flip almost at once. This can cause the whole thing to
	sponanoustly flip orientations. This would not be possible on an infinite board and a larger size would make it much
	less probable.

	- Testing with the modified sizes confirms the above. 
	Small size has far more spontanous flipping. Large size is much more stable once it has become ferromagnetic.
