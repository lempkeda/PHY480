Looking at the graphs of the relative error, it is clear that the optimum number of points for the integrand
evaluated is around 1300 pts. 

Approximation for Milne rule is approximately proportional to 1/N^6 .
This can be seen from the slope of -6 on the log-log plot. 

Accumulated round off error from is sqrt(N)*(epsilon_m).

If we believe the machine error for these long floating point numbers to be in the order of 10^-16,
then the optimal value makes absolute sense. In the region of the plot dominated by round-off error,
the slope is approximately 1/2.

Extrapolating this back on the x_axis, the closer to n = 0, the error approached the machine precision.

Furthermore the ideal n value is close to 10^3 which can be predicted by this line of thinking.

The truncation error starts at 1 and decreases approximately 6 orders of magnitude with every 1 order of magnitude increase
in n. The error from machine inacuracy starts at (epsilon_m) and increases half a magnitue per magnitude n. You could predict
therefore that they would equal eachother before n = 10^3. 

This is fairly close to what actually happens, although it seems the truncation error scales at somethings close 1/N^-5.5
